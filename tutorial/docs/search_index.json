The Pie-charts and Bar-graphs are reactive and change depending on the selection. Users can access the different data tables from the left menu under search, or from the shortcuts at the top menu bar. Left menu can be hidden to provide more space for tables and graphs. 1.1 Projects Individual research projects are typically associated with a published study and has NCBI GEO accession number. Users can search projects from the home page. In the search result page, click each Project ID to view the full description of a project. 1.2 Samples A project may include many samples. Each sample has its own description (full details available by clicking each Sample ID). Each sample has a gene expression profile. Users can search for specific samples using the search box. To change columns displayed in the table, go to the Display Preferences. Users can create lists by selecting specific samples using the “Create a Sample List” button. Users can then specifically download this list as a CSV.Excel/PDF. Samples from your collection can be loaded to other tools like heatmap. 1.3 Comparisons Two groups of samples are compared, and the statistic values (fold change, p-value, adjusted p-values) are computed. There are a lot of meta data available for each comparison. See the dashboard for an overview of key categories, and the detailed description of each comparison has the full information. View full details of a comparison by clicking the “C” (Review Comparison) button. View volcano plot by clicking the “V” (View Volcano Chart) button. Users can also map the comparison data onto wikipathways by clicking the “P” (View Pathway) button. The selected comparisons can be saved to your collection by creating a list using the “Create a Comparison List” button for easy loading into the plotting tools. 1.4 Genes The genome-wide gene expression values were detected in each sample using RNA-Seq or microarrays. All the human genes that have expression values are listed in gene table. The gene annotation from different platforms were all mapped to NCBI gene ID (EntrezID) for consistency across platforms. To find a gene, Users can specifically search in each field like gene symbol, gene description, gene alias, NCBI gene ID, Ensembl gene ID or Uniprot ID in the Advanced Search option. For some common genes, the symbols used in publications are often not the official symbol, and users can try search alias field in Advanced Search. For example, TP53 is often referred to as P53 in publication. Users need to search P53 in alias or tumor protein p53 in description to find it if you don’t know its official symbol. The NCBI Gene search https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene is a good source to get official gene symbols and IDs. Users can view full details of a gene by clicking the “G” (Review Gene) button. 1.5 Saved Genes and Comparisons Users can save selected genes or comparison for future use (e.g. multiple gene and multiple comparisons bubble plot). From gene search, check the genes you want to save, and click the yellow button “save selected genes Similarly, you can save comparisons. To view saved genes, click “My Results” link on the left menu and then “Gene Lists.” Similarly, to view the saved comparisons, select “Comparison Lists” under “My Results”: "],["visualize-gene-expression.html", "Chapter 2 Visualize Gene Expression 2.1 View Gene Expression from RNA-Seq", " Chapter 2 Visualize Gene Expression For each gene, Users can view its expression levels across multiple samples. Most data in OmicsView are from microarray data, consisting of more than 50K samples, and nearly 3000 samples are from RNA-Seq. 2.1 View Gene Expression from RNA-Seq Choose the Gene Expression from RNA-Seq -&gt; Single Gene from left menu, and enter the official symbol of gene. Alternatively, in the gene details page, click View Gene Expression link. As an optional step, Users can choose what sample attributes to pass to the plot and use data filter to choose only a subset of data points. The Data Filter can be very useful if there are too many data points and you can focus on a few diseases or tissue types. The screenshots below show default boxplot showing all diseases, and by after filtering for few diseases. Plot showing all disease states (scroll to view other diseases). 5000 randomly selected data points out of 9538 are shown. Plot after data filtering was applied to select a few diseases. Now 410 out of 9538 data points are shown. The data filter pop-up window was shown to the left of the box plot in the screen shot below. "],["visualize-comparison-data.html", "Chapter 3 Visualize Comparison Data", " Chapter 3 Visualize Comparison Data There are 235 comparisons in the demo system, covering different categories including Disease vs. Normal, Treatment vs. Control, Tissue 1 vs. Tissue 2 etc. The system offers many ways to visualize the data and help users find the most interesting data related to their study. ## Dashboard View of Comparison The dashboard shows a summary of all the comparisons.

This is achieved through the “Internal Data” option under “My Results.” To add a new dataset, click on the link “Import Internal Data” that will lead you to a page like below. 5.1 Data Type There are three types of project data. The file requirements for each data type are summarized in the table below. "],["advanced-analyses.html", "Chapter 6 Advanced Analyses 6.1 Correlation Tools", " Chapter 6 Advanced Analyses 6.1 Correlation Tools Once the user has identified a gene of interest, the user can use correlation tools to find other genes that share similar (or opposite) profiles in terms of gene expression or fold change. First, enter the gene of interest, and samples to be used for correlation. In the example below, we entered OSM gene, and 69 samples involved in Crohn disease.

The DiseaseLand data service uses common analysis pipelines to quantify and normalize publicly available microarray and RNA-seq expression data from raw files. For each project, and each sample, metadata are curated to apply controlled vocabularies and ensure consistent formatting of terms. Information on the data processing pipeline and DiseaseLand product is available at the following links ( http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=DiseaseLand_Curation_Pipeline, http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=Omicsoft_Affymetrix_Microarray_Preprocessing, http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=RNA-Seq_Normalized_FPKM_Values_in_Land ). The data in OmicsView was exported from DiseaseLand prior to 8/27/2019. No OmicsView data can be exported from the portal, distributed with a software package, or otherwise redistributed without express permission from QIAGEN.
