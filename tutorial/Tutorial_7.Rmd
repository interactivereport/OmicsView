Public datasets
The public datasets that are accessible through OmicsView are a subset of the DiseaseLand https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/diseaseland/ database. The DiseaseLand data service uses common analysis pipelines to quantify and normalize publicly available microarray and RNA-seq expression data from raw files. For each project, and each sample, metadata are curated to apply controlled vocabularies and ensure consistent formatting of terms. Information on the data processing pipeline and DiseaseLand product is available at the following links ( http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=DiseaseLand_Curation_Pipeline, http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=Omicsoft_Affymetrix_Microarray_Preprocessing, http://www.arrayserver.com/wiki/index.php?title=RNA-Seq_Normalized_FPKM_Values_in_Land ). The data in OmicsView was exported from DiseaseLand prior to 8/27/2019. No OmicsView data can be exported from the portal, distributed with a software package, or otherwise redistributed without express permission from QIAGEN.
