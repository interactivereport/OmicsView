# Visualize Gene Expression

For each gene, Users can view its expression levels across multiple samples. Most data in OmicsView are from microarray data, consisting of more than 50K samples, and nearly 3000 samples are from RNA-Seq.

## View Gene Expression from RNA-Seq

Choose the Gene Expression from RNA-Seq -> Single Gene from left menu, and enter the official symbol of gene. Alternatively, in the gene details page, click View Gene Expression link.

As an optional step, Users can choose what sample attributes to pass to the plot and use data filter to choose only a subset of data points.
The Data Filter can be very useful if there are too many data points and you can focus on a few diseases or tissue types. 
The screenshots below show default boxplot showing all diseases, and by after filtering for few diseases.

Plot after data filtering was applied to select a few diseases. Now 410 out of 9538 data points are shown. The data filter pop-up window was shown to the left of the box plot in the screen shot below.
