  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Interleukins are low molecular weight proteins that bind to cell surface receptors and act in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion. They were first identified as factors produced by leukocytes but are now known to be produced by many other cells throughout the body. They have pleiotropic effects on cells which bind them, impacting processes such as tissue growth and repair, hematopoietic homeostasis, and multiple levels of the host defense against pathogens where they are an essential part of the immune system.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin 1 (IL1) signals via Interleukin 1 receptor 1 (IL1R1), the only signaling-capable IL1 receptor. This is a single chain type 1 transmembrane protein comprising an extracellular ligand binding domain and an intracellular  region called the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain that is structurally conserved and shared by other members of the two families of receptors (Xu et al. 2000). This domain is also shared by the downstream adapter molecule MyD88. IL1 binding to IL1R1 leads to the recruitment of a second receptor chain termed the IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP or IL1RAcP) enabling the formation of a high-affinity ligand-receptor complex that is capable of signal transduction. Intracellular signaling is initiated by the recruitment of MyD88 to the IL-1R1/IL1RAP complex. IL1RAP is only recruited to IL1R1 when IL1 is present; it is believed that a TIR domain signaling complex is formed between the receptor and the adapter TIR domains. The recruitment of MyD88 leads to the recruitment of Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-1 and -4, probably via their death domains. IRAK4 then activates IRAK1, allowing IRAK1 to autophosphorylate. Both IRAK1 and IRAK4 then dissociate from MyD88 (Brikos et al. 2007) which remains stably complexed with IL-1R1 and IL1RAP. They in turn interact with Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR)-Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Deng et al. 2000). TRAF6 is then thought to auto-ubiquinate, attaching K63-polyubiquitin to itself with the assistance of the E2 conjugating complex Ubc13/Uev1a. K63-pUb-TRAF6 recruits Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) in a complex with TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, which both contain nuclear zinc finger motifs that interact with K63-polyubiquitin chains (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al. 1999). This activates TAK1, which then activates  inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase 2 (IKK2 or IKKB) within the IKK complex, the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of IkappaB. The IKK complex also contains the scaffold protein NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO). TAK1 also couples to the upstream kinases for p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). IRAK1 undergoes K63-linked polyubiquination; Pellino E3 ligases are important in this process. (Butler et al. 2007; Ordureau et al. 2008). The activity of these proteins is greatly enhanced by IRAK phosphorylation (Schauvliege et al. 2006), leading to K63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1. This recruits NEMO to IRAK1, with NEMO binding to polyubiquitin (Conze et al. 2008).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAK1 activates IKKB (and IKK), resulting in phosphorylation of the inhibitory IkB proteins and enabling translocation of NFkB to the nucleus; IKKB also phosphorylates NFkB p105, leading to its degradation and the subsequent release of active TPL2 that triggers the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 MAPK cascade. TAK1 can also trigger the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways via activating the upstream MKKs3, 4 and 6. The MAPK pathways activate a number of downstream kinases and transcription factors that co-operate with NFkB to induce the expression of a range of TLR/IL-1R-responsive genes. There are reports suggesting that IL1 stimulation increases nuclear localization of IRAK1 (Bol et al. 2000) and that nuclear IRAK1 binds to the promoter of NFkB-regulated gene and IkBa, enhancing binding of the NFkB p65 subunit to NFkB responsive elements within the IkBa promoter.  IRAK1 is required for IL1-induced Ser-10 phosphorylation of histone H3 in vivo (Liu et al. 2008). However, details of this aspect of IRAK1 signaling mechanisms remain unclear.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The IL-1 family of cytokines that interact with the Type 1 IL-1R include IL-1 Alpha (IL1A), IL-1 Beta (IL1B) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RAP). IL1RAP is synthesized with a signal peptide and secreted as a mature protein via the classical secretory pathway.  IL1A and IL1B are synthesised as cytoplasmic precursors (pro-IL1A and pro-IL1B) in activated cells. They have no signal sequence, precluding secretion via the classical ER-Golgi route (Rubartelli et al. 1990). Processing of pro-IL1B to the active form requires caspase-1 (Thornberry et al. 1992), which is itself activated by a molecular scaffold termed the inflammasome (Martinon et al. 2002). Processing and release of IL1B are thought to be closely linked, because mature IL1B is only seen inside inflammatory cells just prior to release (Brough et al. 2003). It has been reported that in monocytes a fraction of cellular IL1B is released by the regulated secretion of late endosomes and early lysosomes, and that this may represent a cellular compartment where caspase-1 processing of pro-IL1B takes place (Andrei et al. 1999). Shedding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane has also been proposed as a mechanism of secretion (MacKenzie et al. 2001). These proposals superceded previous models in which non-specific release due to cell lysis and passage through a plasma membrane pore were considered. However, there is evidence in the literature that supports all of these mechanisms and there is still controversy over how IL1B exits from cells (Brough &amp; Rothwell 2007). A calpain-like potease has been reported to be important for the processing of  pro-IL1A, but much less is known about how IL1A is released from cells and what specific roles it plays in biology.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5 and Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptors form a family of heterodimeric receptors that have specific alpha chains but share a common beta subunit, often referred to as the common beta (Bc). Both subunits contain extracellular conserved motifs typical of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The cytoplasmic domains have limited similarity with other cytokine receptors and lack detectable catalytic domains such as tyrosine kinase domains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; IL-3 is a 20-26 kDa product of CD4+ T cells that acts on the most immature marrow progenitors. IL-3 is capable of inducing the growth and differentiation of multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, macrophages, lymphoid and erythroid cells. IL-3 has been used to support the proliferation of murine cell lines with properties of multi-potential progenitors, immature myeloid as well as T and pre-B lymphoid cells (Miyajima et al. 1992). IL-5 is a hematopoietic growth factor responsible for the maturation and differentiation of eosinophils. It was originally defined as a T-cell-derived cytokine that triggers activated B cells for terminal differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. It also promotes the generation of cytotoxic T-cells from thymocytes. IL-5 induces the expression of IL-2 receptors (Kouro &amp; Takatsu 2009). GM-CSF is produced by cells (T-lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, endothelial cells, mast cells) found at sites of inflammatory responses. It stimulates the growth and development of progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages, and the production and maturation of dendritic cells. It stimulates myeloblast and monoblast differentiation, synergises with Epo in the proliferation of erythroid and megakaryocytic  progenitor cells, acts as an autocrine mediator of growth for some types of acute myeloid leukemia, is a strong chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils. It enhances the activity of neutrophils and macrophages. Under steady-state conditions GM-CSF is not essential for the production of myeloid cells, but it is required for the proper development of alveolar macrophages, otherwise, pulmonary alvelolar proteinosis (PAP) develops. A growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF plays a key role in emergency hematopoiesis (predominantly myelopoiesis)  in response to infection, including the production of granulocytes and macrophages in the bone marrow and their maintenance, survival, and functional activation at sites of injury or insult  (Hercus et al. 2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All three receptors have alpha chains that bind their specific ligands with low affinity (de Groot et al. 1998). Bc then associates with the alpha chain forming a high affinity receptor (Geijsen et al. 2001), though the in vivo receptor is likely be a higher order multimer as recently demonstrated for the GM-CSF receptor (Hansen et al. 2008).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The receptor chains lack intrinsic kinase activity, instead they interact with and activate signaling kinases, notably Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). These phosphorylate the common beta subunit, allowing recruitment of signaling molecules such as Shc, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). The cytoplasmic domain of Bc has two distinct functional domains: the membrane proximal region mediates the induction of proliferation-associated genes such as c-myc, pim-1 and oncostatin M. This region binds multiple signal-transducing proteins including JAK2 (Quelle et al. 1994), STATs, c-Src and PI3 kinase (Rao and Mufson, 1995). The membrane distal domain is required for cytokine-induced growth inhibition and is necessary for the viability of hematopoietic cells (Inhorn et al. 1995). This region interacts with signal-transducing proteins such as Shc (Inhorn et al. 1995) and SHP and mediates the transcriptional activation of c-fos, c-jun, c-Raf and p70S6K (Reddy et al. 2000).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure reproduced by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Leukemia, WL Blalock et al. 13:1109-1166, copyright 1999.

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that is produced by T cells in response to antigen stimulation. Originally, IL-2 was discovered because of its potent growth factor activity on activated T cells in vitro and was therefore named 'T cell growth factor' (TCGF). However, the generation of IL-2- and IL-2 receptor-deficient mice revealed that IL-2 also plays a regulatory role in the immune system by suppressing autoimmune responses. Two main mechanisms have been identified that explain this suppressive function: (1) IL-2 sensitizes activated T cells for activation-induced cell death (AICD) and (2) IL-2 is critical for the survival and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which possess potent immunosuppressive properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IL-2 signaling occurs when IL-2 binds to the heterotrimeric high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which consists of alpha, beta and gamma chains. The IL-2R was identified in 1981 via radiolabeled ligand binding (Robb et al. 1981). The IL-2R alpha chain was  identified in 1982 (Leonard et al.), the beta chain in 1986/7 (Sharon et al. 1986, Teshigawara et al. 1987) and the IL-2R gamma chain in 1992 (Takeshita et al.). The high affinity of IL-2 binding to the IL-2R is created by a very rapid association rate to the IL-2R alpha chain, combined with a much slower dissociation rate contributed by the combination of the IL-2R beta and gamma chains (Wang &amp; Smith 1987). After antigen stimulation, T cells upregulate the high-affinity IL-2R alpha chain; IL-2R alpha captures IL-2 and this complex then associates with the constitutively expressed IL-2R beta and gamma chains.  The IL-2R gamma chain is shared by several other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors, and consequently is often referred to as the Common gamma chain (Gamma-c).
The tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are constitutively associated with IL-2R beta and Gamma-c respectively, are activated resulting in phosphorylation of three critical tyrosine residues in the IL-2R beta cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues enable recruitment of the adaptor molecule Shc, activating the MAPK and PI3K pathways, and the transcription factor STAT5. After phosphorylation, STAT5 forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus and initiate gene expression. While STAT5 activation is critical for IL-2 function in most cell types, the contribution of the PI3K/Akt pathway differs between distinct T cell subsets. In Tregs for example, PI3K/Akt is not involved in IL-2 signaling and this may explain some of the different functional outcomes of IL-2 signaling in Tregs vs. effector T cells. </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-7 (IL7) is produced primarily by T zone fibroblastic reticular cells found in lymphoid organs, and also expressed by non-hematopoietic stromal cells present in other tissues including the skin, intestine and liver. It is an essential survival factor for lymphocytes, playing a key anti-apoptotic role in T-cell development, as well as mediating peripheral T-cell maintenance and proliferation. This dual function is reflected in a dose-response relationship that distinguishes the survival function from the proliferative activity; low doses of IL7 (&lt;1 ng/ml) sustain only survival, higher doses  (&gt;1 ng/ml) promote survival and cell cycling (Kittipatarin et al. 2006, Swainson et al. 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The IL7 receptor is a heterodimeric complex of the the common cytokine-receptor gamma chain (IL2RG, CD132, or Gc) and the IL7-receptor alpha chain (IL7R, IL7RA, CD127). Both chains are members of the type 1 cytokine family. Neither chain is unique to the IL7 receptor as IL7R is utilized by the receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) while IL2RG is shared with the receptors for IL2, IL4, IL9, IL15 and IL21. IL2RG consists of a single transmembrane region and a 240aa extracellular region that includes a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain thought to be involved in receptor complex formation. It is expressed on most lymphocyte populations. Null mutations of IL2RG in humans cause X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), which has a phenotype of  severely reduced T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell populations, but normal numbers of B cells. In addition to reduced T- and NK-cell numbers, Il2rg knockout mice also have dramatically reduced B-cell populations suggesting that Il2rg is more critical for B-cell development in mice than in humans. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype due to IL7R mutations (see Puel &amp; Leonard 2000), or a partial deficiency of IL7R (Roifman et al. 2000) have markedly reduced circulating T cells, but normal levels of peripheral blood B cells and NK cells, similar to the phenotype of IL2RG mutations, highlighting a requirement for IL7 in T cell lymphopoiesis. It has been suggested that IL7 is essential for murine, but not human B cell development, but recent studies indicate that IL7 is essential for human B cell production from adult bone marrow and that IL7-induced expansion of the progenitor B cell compartment is increasingly critical for human B cell production during later stages of development (Parrish et al. 2009).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IL7 has been shown to induce rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs 1 and 3, and concomitantly tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT5a/b (Foxwell et al. 1995). IL7R was shown to directly induce the activation of JAKs and STATs by van der Plas et al. (1996). Jak1 and Jak3 knockout mice displayed severely impaired thymic development, further supporting their importance in IL7 signaling (Rodig et al. 1998, Nosaka et al. 1995).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of STAT5 in IL7 signaling has been studied largely in mouse models. Tyr449 in the cytoplasmic domain of IL7RA is required for T-cell development in vivo and activation of JAK/STAT5 and PI3k/Akt pathways (Jiang et al. 2004, Pallard et al. 1999). T-cells from an IL7R Y449F knock-in mouse did not activate STAT5 (Osbourne et al. 2007), indicating that IL7 regulates STAT5 activity via this key tyrosine residue. STAT5 seems to enhance proliferation of multiple cell lineages in mouse models but it remains unclear whether STAT5 is required solely for survival signaling or also for the induction of proliferative activity (Kittipatarin &amp; Khaled, 2007).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The model for IL7 receptor signaling is believed to resemble that of other Gc family cytokines, based on detailed studies of the IL2 receptor, where IL2RB binds constitutively to JAK1 while JAK3 is pre-associated uniquely with the IL2RG chain. Extending this model to IL7 suggests a similar series of events: IL7R constitutively associated with JAK1 binds IL7, the resulting trimer recruits IL2RG:JAK3, bringing JAK1 and JAK3 into proximity. The association of both chains of the IL7 receptor orients the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor chains so that their associated kinases (Janus and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases) can phosphorylate sequence elements on the cytoplasmic domains (Jiang et al. 2005). JAKs have low intrinsic enzymatic activity, but after mutual phosphorylation acquire much higher activity, leading to phosphorylation of the critical Y449 site on IL7R. This site binds STAT5 and possibly other signaling adapters, they in turn become phosphorylated by JAK1 and/or JAK3. Phosphorylated STATs translocate to the nucleus and trigger the transcriptional events of their target genes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in IL7 signaling is controversial. It is a potential T-cell survival pathway because in many cell types PI3K signaling regulates diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle progression, transcription, and metabolism. The ERK/MAPK pathway does not appear to be involved in IL7 signaling (Crawley et al. 1996).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not clear how IL7 influences cell proliferation. In the absence of a proliferative signal such as IL7 or IL3, dependent lymphocytes arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. To exit this phase, cells typically activate specific G1 Cyclin-dependent kinases/cyclins and down regulate cell cycle inhibitors such as Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (Cdkn1b or p27kip1). There is indirect evidence suggesting a possible role for IL7 stimulated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, obtained from transformed cell lines and thymocytes, but not confirmed by observations using primary T-cells (Kittipatarin &amp; Khaled, 2007). IL7 withdrawal results in G1/S cell cycle arrest and is correlated with loss of cdk2 activity (Geiselhart et al. 2001), both events which are known to be regulated by the dephosphorylating activity of Cdc25A. Expression of a p38 MAPK-resistant Cdc25A mutant in an IL-7-dependent T-cell line as well as in peripheral, primary T-cells was sufficient to sustain cell survival and promote cell cycling for several days in the absence of IL7 (Khaled et al. 2005). Cdkn1b is a member of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent cell cycle inhibitors (CKIs) that negatively regulates the G1/S transition. In IL7 dependent T-cells, the expression of Cdkn1b was sufficient to cause G1 arrest in the presence of IL7. Withdrawal of IL7 induced the upregulation of Cdkn1b and arrested cells in G1 while siRNA knockout of Cdkn1b enhanced cell cycle progression. However, adoptive transfer of Cdkn1b-deficient lymphocytes into IL7 deficient mice indicated that loss of Cdkn1b could only partially compensate for the IL7 signal needed by T-cells to expand in a lymphopenic environment (Li et al. 2006), so though Cdkn1b may be involved in negative regulation of the cell cycle through an effect on cdk2 activity, its absence is not sufficient to fully induce cell cycling under lymphopenic conditions.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-17 (IL17) is a family of cytokines (Kawaguchi et al. 2004, Gu et al. 2013). IL17A, the founding member of the family,  member of this family, is able to induce the production of other cytokines and chemokines, such as IL6, IL8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a variety of cell types, including activated T-cells. It plays a pivotal role in host defenses in response to microbial infection, and is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergic syndromes. IL17 activates several downstream signalling pathways including NFkB, MAPKs and C/EBPs, inducing the expression of antibacterial peptides, proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). IL17 can stabilize the mRNA of genes induced by TNF-alpha. IL17 signal transduction is mediated by the cytosolic adaptor molecule Act1 (also known as CIKS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The receptor for IL17D is unknown (Gu et al. 2013).</Comment>

  <DataNode TextLabel="Interleukin-6 family&#xA;signaling" GraphId="dcd76" Type="Pathway">
    <Comment Source="Reactome">The interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines is defined by the shared use of the common signal transducing receptor gp130 beta-subunit. This family includes structurally and functionally related IL-6, IL-11, Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM) cardiotrophin-1 (CTF1) and Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) (Taga &amp; Kishimoto 1999, Taga 1996, Kishimoto et al. 1995). The sharing of gp130 explains at least in part the redundancy of the actions of these cytokines. The cytokines IL-6 and IL-11 bind to their corresponding receptors IL-6R and IL-11R, respectively, resulting in complex formations, which associate with gp130, leading to gp130-homodimer formation and signal initiation. LIF, CNTF, OSM, CTF1, CRLF1 , and CLCF1, signal via gp130/LIF-R heterodimeric receptor complexes (Taga &amp; Kishimoto 1997, mousa &amp; Bakhiet 2013). OSM also signals via a receptor complex consisting of gp130 and OSMR. These cytokines play an important role in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as gene activation, proliferation and differentiation (Heinrich et al. 1998). Although each member of the IL-6 family signals through the distinct receptor complex, the underlying signaling mechanism is similar in each case: the first event after cytokine stimulation is assembly of receptor complexes, the activation of receptor-associated kinases of the janus kinase (JAK) family then follows. Activation of JAK kinases is the pivotal step to initiate downstream cytoplasmic signaling cascades involving recruitment and phosphorylation of transcription factors of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, which dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to enhancer elements of respective target genes leading to transcriptional activation (Nakashima &amp; Taga 1998).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The interleukin-20 (IL20) subfamily comprises IL19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24 and IL-26. They are members of the larger IL-10 family, but have been grouped together based on their usage of common receptor subunits and similarities in their target-cell profiles and biological functions. Members of the IL20 subfamily facilitate the communication between leukocytes and epithelial cells, thereby enhancing innate defence mechanisms and tissue repair processes at epithelial surfaces. Much of the understanding of this group of cytokines is based on IL22, which is the most studied member (Rutz et al. 2014).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">FLT3 is a member of the Class III Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Family, which also includes FMS, KIT, PDGFRA and PDGFRB. It binds the cytokine FLT3LG (Hannum et al. 1994), which regulates differentiation, proliferation and survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells and dendritic cells. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FLT3LG is probably dimeric. Binding to monomeric FLT3 induces receptor dimerization (Verstraete et al. 2011, Grafone et al. 2012), which promotes phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain, activating the receptor and consequently the downstream effectors. Early studies of FLT3 using a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of human FMS and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of FLT3 demonstrated the activation of PLCG1, RASA1, SHC, GRB2, VAV, FYN, and SRC pathways. PLCG1, SHC, GRB2, and FYN were found to directly associate with the cytoplasmic domain of FLT3 (Dosil et al. 1993). Later studes using the full-length human receptor identified that FLT3LG binding to FLT3 leads to FLT3 autophosphorylation, association of FLT3 with GRB2, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC and CBL, formation of a complex that includes CBL, the p85 subunit of PI3K and GAB2, and tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB1 and GAB2 and their association with PTPN11 (SHP-2) and GRB2. PTPN11 (SHP-2), but not PTPN6 (SHP-1) binds GRB2 directly and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FLT3LG stimulation. INPP5D (SHIP) also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after FLT3LG stimulation but binds to SHC. GAB1 and GAB2 are rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated after FLT3LG stimulation of cells, interacting with tyrosine-phosphorylated PTPN11, p85 subunit of PI3K, GRB2, and SHC (Zhang &amp; Broxmeyer 2000). GAB may mediate the downstream activation of PTPN11, PI3K and thereby PDK1 and AKt which activate the mTOR pathway (Grafone et al. 2012), and possibly the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. (Zhang et al. 1999, Marchetto et al. 1999, Zhang e&amp; Broxmeyer 2000). Activation of FLT3 leads to limited activation of STAT5A via a JAK-independent mechanism (Zhang et al. 2000).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FLT3 is mutated in about 1/3 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, either by internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain or by point mutations usually involving the kinase domain (KD). Both types of mutation constitutively activate FLT3 (Small 2006).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R, GCSFR, CD114) is a cell-surface receptor for the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF3, GCSF) (Larsen et al. 1990, Panapoulos &amp; Watowich 2008). It is present on precursor cells in the bone marrow. CSF3 initiates cell proliferation and differentiation into mature neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages.  

CSF3 exists as a dimer and higher order oligomeric structures; only the dimer exhibits high affinity binding (Hiraoka &amp; Anaguchi et al. 1994). CSF3R ligand-binding is associated with dimerization of the receptor (Aritomi et al. 1999, Tamada et al. 2006, Layton &amp; Hall 2006) and signal transduction through Jak/STAT, Lyn and Erk1/2. Mutations in CSF3R are a cause of Kostmann syndrome, also known as severe congenital neutropenia (Zeidler &amp; Welte 2002, Vandenberghe &amp; Beel 2011).</Comment>

Interleukin-12 receptor subunit beta-1 (IL12RB1) dimers, but not monomers, bind IL12, with an apparent affinity of 2 to 5 nM (Chua et al. 1994). Dimerization of IL12RB appears to be independent of ligand binding  (Chua et al. 1994). This represents low affinity IL12 binding (Chizzonite et al. 1992, Chua et al. 1994). An additional component, IL12RB2, is required for high affinity binding and signaling. </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-14, renamed alpha-taxilin (TXLNA) was originally described as High molecular weight B-cell growth factor (Ambrus et al. 1994). TXLNA binds several forms of syntaxin (Nogami et al. 2003), but not when they are complexed with SNAP25, VAMP2 or STXBP1, suggesting that TXLNA interacts with syntaxins outside the SNARE complex. This observation and a predicted role in intracellular vesicle trafficking led to renaming of the gene. Txlna transgenic mice show a phenotype similar to systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome (Shen et al. 2006). </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The Interleukin-15 (IL15) receptor is a heterotrimer. The alpha subunit (IL15RA) is structurally related to the alpha subunit of the IL2 receptor and determines high affinity binding for IL15. However it is dispensable for low affinity binding and signalling; when IL15 levels are high the IL2RB:IL2RG dimer can transduce IL15 signals in the absence of IL15RA (Giri et al. 1995, Anderson et al. 1995). Signaling through the IL15 receptor is believed to be initiated when IL15RA binds IL15 and presents it  to IL2RB and IL2RG (Ring et al. 2012). This parallels the mechanism of IL2 signaling, where the main role of the equivalent IL2 receptor alpha chain is enrichment of IL2 on the cell surface, lowering the entropic barrier for the binding of IL2 to IL2RB and IL2RG.</Comment>

Amino-terminal deletions of IL16 reduce its capacity for secretion (Zhou et al. 1999), but the significance of this is unclear.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">CD4 is a receptor for Interleukin-16 (IL16), explaining how IL16 acts as a chemoattractant for a variety of CD4+ immune cells (Cruikshank et al. 2000, Cruikshank &amp; Little 2008).

Signaling mediated by CD4 requires the amino acid sequence W345 to S350, located in the proximal end of the D4 domain. CD4 does not appear to require a co-receptor for IL16. Data from CD4 knockout mice suggests that there may be an additional IL16 receptor (Mathy et al. 2000).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The interleukin-23 (IL23) receptor is a heterodimer composed of a p19 subunit IL23R and a p40 subunit IL12RB1, which is also a component of the IL12 receptor (Lupardus &amp; Garcia 2008). IL23R does not interact with IL12, but pairs with IL12RB1 to confer IL23 responsiveness on cells expressing both subunits (Parham et al. 2002).  

IL23 is produced by antigen-presenting cells and promotes the expansion and survival of a distinct lineage of T cells, Th17 (Langrish et al. 2005). Increasing evidence supports the idea that Th17 cells do not require traditional Th1 or Th2 transcription factors or regulatory genes, and that their differentiation is inhibited by IFN-gamma and IL4 (Hoeve eta al. 2006). Naive T cells cultured in the presence of TGF-beta1 and IL6 and in the absence of IFN-gamma or IL4 are polarized to Th17 cells and upregulate IL23R (Veldhoen et al. 2006). Subsequently, IL23 appears to be required for the expansion and survival of Th17 cells. Like Th1 and Th2 T cells, mature effector Th17 cells remain committed to their lineage, even in the presence of other Th polarizing cytokines (Harrington et al. 2005). The IL23 receptor-ligand interaction has been shown to activate Stat3, resulting in binding to the IL17A and IL17F promoters. The T-cell response activated by IL23 is attenuated by SOCS3, which acts as a feedback inhibitor to regulate Th17 cells Chen et al. 2006).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knockout mice deficient in either p40 or p19, or in either subunit of the IL23 receptor (IL23R and IL12RB1) have reduced symptoms of multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease suggesting that IL23 is involved in these inflammatory diseases (Kikly et al 2006). As it is not clear whether the dimeric receptor can form in the absence of ligand, formation of the receptor dimer is represented here as an uncertain event.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-27 (IL27) is a heterodimer of IL27p28 (IL27A) and Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3 (EBI3/IL27B). IL27A is a typical four helical cytokine while IL27B resembles soluble cytokine receptors. IL27 is structurally similar to IL12 and IL23, but the subunits are not linked by a disulfide bond. This could allow association of subunits produced by different cells in the extracellular space, like IL6, but IL27A appears to be poorly secreted without coexpression of IL27B though IL27B is readily secreted.</Comment>

They are distantly related to type I interferons (IFNs) are members of the class II cytokine family, which includes type I, II, and III interferons and the IL10 family (IL10, IL19, IL20, IL22, IL24, and IL26). They are encoded by genes that form a cluster on 19q13. Expression of all three can be induced by viral infection. They share a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consists of interleukin 28 receptor alpha (IL28RA) and interleukin-10 receptor beta (IL10RB), which is also part of the receptor complexes for IL10, IL22, IL24 and IL26. </Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">interleukin-34 (IL34) was identified as a potent activator of monocytes and macrophages, signaling through Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R) with a distinct tissue distribution from CSF1 (Lin et al. 2008). IL34 and CSF1 share many functional properties. IL34 has no appreciable sequence similarity with any other protein but shares a four-helix bundle structure seen in CSF1 (Garceau et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2012). IL34 forms a noncovalently linked dimer (Ma et al. 2012) whereas CSF1 contains an intersubunit disulfide bond. The structure of the IL34:CSF1R complex shows a similar ligand-receptor assembly to that of CSF1:CSF1R.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">The receptor for Interleukin-34 (IL34) is colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), also called macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSF-R). Binding of the dimeric ligand leads to receptor dimerisation (Ma et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2012). CSF1R activates several signaling pathways including JAK-STAT3, 5A/B, phosphorylation of PIK3R1, PLCG2, GRB2, SLA2 and CBL. PLCG2 phosphorylation leads to increassed production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3), which activate protein kinase C family members, especially PRKCD. Phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, leads to activation of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Activated CSF1R also mediates activation of MAPK1 (ERK2) or MAPK3 (ERK1) and the SRC family kinases SRC, FYN and YES1. Activated CSF1R binds GRB2 and promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC1 and INPP5D (SHIP1). Signaling is down regulated by protein phosphatases such as INPP5D that can dephosphorylate the receptor and its downstream effectors.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2), sometimes called Interleukin-13 binding protein (IL13BP) is a high affinity receptor for IL13 (Kd = 250 pmol/L) but is not sufficient to render cells responsive to IL13, even in the presence of IL4R (Donaldson et al. 1998). It is reported to exist in soluble form (Zhang et al. 1997); overexpression reduces STAT6 signaling (Kawakami et al. 2001). Its function may be to prevent IL13 signaling via the functional IL4R:IL13RA1 cell surface receptor. IL13BP is overexpressed in some human cancers and enhances cell invasion (Joshi &amp; Puri 2012).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="Reactome">Interleukin-18 binding protein (IL18BP) is a constitutively secreted protein, with an exceptionally high affinity for IL18 (400 pM) (Kim et al. 2000). It is present in the serum of healthy humans at a 20-fold molar excess compared to IL18 (Novick et al. 2001) and may blunt the Th1 response to foreign organisms, thereby reducing any autoimmune responses to a routine infection (Dinarello et al. 2013).</Comment>
